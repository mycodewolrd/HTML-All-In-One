                            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using the markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.</p>

                            <h3>HTML Basic Format Structure:</h3>

                            <p>#DOCTYPE! html> – A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.
                                <br>

                               <#html> – This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.
                                <br>
                                <#head> – This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.
                                <br>
                                <#body> - The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end</pre>

                            <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

                                While html uses tags, css uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>

                             <h3>CSS Syntax:</h3>
                                <>CSS comprises style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.
A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.
<br/>
Selector -- h1
<br/>
Declaration -- {color:blue;font size:12px;} 
<br/>
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
<br/>
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
<br/>
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
<br/>
For Example:  color is property and blue is value.
<br/>
              font-size is property and 12px is value.
              <br/>
CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
<br/>
Example : In the following example all p elements will be center-aligned, with a blue text color:</p>
